# Exercise 2.7 (not done)

This exercise is not done since I could not get it work. The docker image build directly from the
ml-kurkkumopo-training repository does not run. The python software crashes and no training is done.

I assume the purpose of this exercise is not to read the python code but just make the three parts
to work together. Maybe there is some problem with the ml-kurkkumopo-training repository? (tested
in 11.1.2020).
